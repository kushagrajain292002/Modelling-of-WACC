This is a small base project where I built a financial model of Avenue Supermarts Ltd to calculate its WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).
The purpose of this project was to practically apply financial concepts like Beta, CAPM, and capital structure, while learning how Python can support financial analysis.

What I Did:

a) Collected historical closing prices of:
   -Avenue Supermarts
   -Peer companies
   -NIFTY 50
b) Calculated weekly returns
c)Estimated Beta using:
   -Slope formula
   -Covariance method
   -Regression analysis
d)Calculated beta for peer companies
e)Used median peer beta to estimate Cost of Equity
f)Computed WACC using market cap, debt, and capital structure data

How Python Was Used:

I used Python (mainly yfinance, pandas, numpy):
   -To fetch historical stock prices and index data
   -To gather market cap, total debt, and financial ratios
   -To calculate returns and beta programmatically
   -To export cleaned data into Excel for financial modelling

Although financial data is available on websites like Yahoo Finance, many details are limited or require subscriptions. Using Python allowed automated and structured data collection.
